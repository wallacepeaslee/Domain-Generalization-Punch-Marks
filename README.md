# Domain-Generalization-Punch-Marks
Code used for the paper "Domain Generalization and Punch Mark Classification"

Most of the code in this repository is from the [DomainBed](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed/tree/8ee9b5831bc733738361ae119b1f1dd1d29a4ae8?tab=readme-ov-file) repository, associated with the paper [In Search of Lost Domain Generalization](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=lQdXeXDoWtI). Portions of DomainBed have been adapted for the project at hand. The DomainBed version used, as well as our modifications, are included in this repository to aid reproducibility.
